## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `brama version`, which prints the version the binary was built from.
- Add `brama init`, which detects the adapter and writes a starting `brama.yaml`. It
  writes no credentials and no classification — `brama anonymize init` owns the
  `anonymize` block, and until it runs every column is unclassified. (#1)
- Add the `brama.yaml` schema: `version`, `app.adapter`, `app.paths`, `environments`,
  `servers`, and `anonymize`. Unknown keys are rejected rather than ignored, so a
  typo cannot silently mean "no classification". (#1)
- Add `--json` and `--dry-run` to `brama init`. `--dry-run` shows the file it would
  write and writes nothing.
- Add `--adapter` to `brama init`, to name the adapter when detection cannot.
- Add `brama --version`, alongside the existing `brama version` subcommand.
- Add `--help` for every command, with generated manpages and shell completions.

### Changed

- `brama` now exits `1` rather than `2` for an unknown command or a bad flag.
